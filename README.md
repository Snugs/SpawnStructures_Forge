Do you or your server like to have a building at your world spawn point to protect or help out new players to the world or those that may die without setting their spawn? Spawn Structures endeavors to streamline this process, generating a custom structure at your world spawn, complete with a lectern, 2 chests with Lootr compatible loot tables - comprised of a Starter Gear chest and a Guides & Catalogs chest, along with a bed available to those that happen to respawn during the night... Spawn Structures brings convenience to your front door!

### Current Features:
- 1x Starter Structure
- Starter Gear chest (Lootr compatible)
- Guides & Catalogs chest (Lootr compatible)
- Lectern with (mostly) empty Book & Quill
- World Spawn location configured to be INSIDE the Starter Structure

---

### Planned Features:
- Better structure generation integration with the world
- More structures to choose from as the Starter Structure
- Biome dependant Starter Structures
- Further integration with guidebooks and catalogs from other mods
- Config to accompany the future planned features
- Potentially a map room underneath the spawn structure, so that new players can see where other players' bases and such are?

Of course, I am open to other ideas and suggestions, so do feel free to let me know in the comments!

## FAQ:

#### Q: Can you backport to 1.XX.X?
**A:** Potentially... currently no backports are planned, however, if demand is high and I have some spare time, I will be happy to look into it.

#### Q: Fabric version when?
**A:** Soon! It's in the works, I just have some kinks to iron out first before I'm ready to release its beta version.

Please keep in mind this mod is currently inÂ ***BETA***, as there could be unforeseen bugs and I'm not currently 100% happy with the structure generation integration with the rest of the world. I am working on it however and hope to be in full release soon.

I hope you all enjoy the mod as much as I do! ðŸ˜ƒ
